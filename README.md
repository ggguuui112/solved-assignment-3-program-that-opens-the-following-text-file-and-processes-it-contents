Write a program that opens the following text file and processes it contents. The program should display the following per store:

<ul>

 <li>The total sales for each week. (Should print 5 values – one for each week).</li>

 <li>The average daily sales for each week. (Should print 5 values – one for each week).</li>

 <li>The total sales for all the weeks. (Should print 1 value)</li>

 <li>The average weekly sales. (Should print 1 value)</li>

 <li>The week with the highest amount in sales. (Should print 1 week #)</li>

 <li>The week with the lowest amount in sales. (Should print 1 week #)</li>

</ul>

The file contains the dollars amount of sales that a retail store made each day for a number of weeks. Each line in the file contains thirty five numbers, which are sales numbers for five weeks. The number are separated by space.  Each line in the file represents a separate store.
